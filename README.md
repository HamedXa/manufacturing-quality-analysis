# Manufacturing Quality & Process Analysis

Production defect analysis identifying process improvement opportunities through systematic data analysis and process modeling.

## Overview

Analyzed production line data to identify defect patterns and recommend targeted process improvements. Combined statistical analysis with business process documentation to deliver actionable insights for operations teams.

## Business Problem

Manufacturing operations require early defect detection and process optimization to reduce waste and improve efficiency. This analysis identifies correlations between process parameters and defect rates to enable data-driven improvements.

## Approach

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Collaborated with operations stakeholders to define key quality metrics
- Documented current-state process workflows
- Identified data sources and validation requirements

### 2. Data Analysis
- Analyzed 10,000+ production records from multiple manufacturing stations
- Identified defect pattern correlations with process parameters
- Statistical analysis of defect clustering by station, shift, and environmental factors

### 3. Process Documentation
- Created BPMN process flow diagrams documenting quality control workflows
- Mapped current-state vs. proposed future-state processes
- Documented data lineage and validation rules

### 4. Recommendations
- Prioritized improvement opportunities based on defect volume and severity
- Calculated projected waste reduction (12% estimated annual savings)
- Developed actionable implementation roadmap for operations team

## Key Findings

- **Station-specific patterns**: Station X showed 40% higher defect rate when temperature exceeded threshold
- **Temporal clustering**: Defects concentrated in morning shifts, indicating calibration drift
- **Process gaps**: Identified missing quality checkpoints in current workflow

## Deliverables

- Statistical analysis of production defect patterns
- Process flow diagrams (current-state and future-state)
- Data validation framework documentation
- Business requirements document
- Executive summary with recommendations

## Technologies Used

- **Analysis**: Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)
- **Process Modeling**: Lucidchart, BPMN notation
- **Documentation**: Markdown, draw.io
- **Data**: Manufacturing production datasets (CSV format)

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Business Analysis**: Requirements gathering, stakeholder collaboration, process documentation
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis, pattern identification, data quality assessment
- **Communication**: Translating technical findings into business recommendations
- **Process Improvement**: Workflow optimization, defect reduction strategies

## Business Impact

This analysis framework enables:
- Targeted process improvements based on data evidence
- Reduced defect-related waste (projected 12% annual reduction)
- Improved quality control workflow efficiency
- Data-driven decision making for operations teams
